# AI-Job-Scam-Detector
AI-powered system to detect fake job and internship offers using Google Gemini and Vision APIs

## Problem Statement
Students are increasingly targeted by fake job and internship scams involving fraudulent offer letters, fake companies, and pay-to-work schemes. These scams often appear highly professional and cause financial loss and data theft.

## Solution
We propose an AI-powered web application that analyzes job or internship offers and detects scam indicators using NLP, Google AI services, and verification logic. The system generates a Trust/Risk score with clear explanations.

## Features
- Scam keyword & pattern detection
- Risk score generation (Safe / Suspicious / High Risk)
- Query-based AI explanations using Google Gemini
- Offer letter analysis using Google Vision OCR
- Firebase integration for storing scan results

## Google Technologies Used
- Google Gemini API (AI query answering)
- Google Vision API (OCR for images & documents)
- Firebase Firestore (data storage)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Figma / Canva (UI Design)
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- AI: Google Gemini, Google Vision
- Database: Firebase Firestore
